## Made with

- React
- Node and Express
- React Router

**React** was chosen for the front-end of the MVP due to its component-based architecture, which enables reusable and modular code. It provides a fast and interactive user interface, facilitating a seamless learning experience. 

**Node.js** with **Express** was selected for the back-end due to its efficiency in handling server-side operations and its compatibility with JavaScript, allowing for easier code sharing between the front-end and back-end. 

This combination ensures a unified development stack and smooth communication between the client and server, enabling efficient data retrieval and storage.


## Optimizations

- Accessibility
- Ability to add images and videos 
- Ability to personalize profile 
- Filter and categories for lessons
- Ability to combine the lessons into courses








## Lessons Learned

While building this project, I learned the importance of proper deployment practices and faced challenges in deploying the application effectively. I initially attempted to integrate Redux but decided to switch to a simpler state management approach. Planning the design and functionalities beforehand proved beneficial as it provided a clear roadmap for coding, resulting in a smoother development process.
